## Challenges & Wins
### Challenges
- **Getting to know FE File Structure and Existing Naming Conventions** This wa ssomething proven to be rather confusing for the Frontend team. Although we took the time to plan and study the file structure, naming convetions became rather confusing from the existing repository.  

### Wins/Reflections
- **Working as a full cross poll team, and enjoying our team environment**
- **Organization, Planning, Communication:** Workflow was smooth, communication was strong, documents were shared! Everyone was ready to help each other out and eager to learn from one another. Our planning was thourough and set us up for a really smooth, successful project. 

## Appreciation
